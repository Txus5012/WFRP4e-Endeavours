# WFRP4e - Endeavours
This module adds a macro for the GMs to ask their players which endeavours they will undertake (if any), mainly focused in helping the GMs keep track of the chosen endeavours.

Based in the module [PF2e Exploration Activities](https://github.com/IcyLemonZ/pf2e-exploration-activities).

Available in English and Spanish.

## Instructions
Activate the module and import the macros into your world. You don't have to import the items.

### Endeavours

Select the token(s) that can make endeavours and execute the "WFRP4e Endeavours" macro. The player(s) will be prompted to select an endeavour:

![Endeavours Dialog](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/349f477b-cc51-4709-8ab3-ebb221a332da)

- **Select**: The character will do the selected endeavour.

- **Other**: Change between "Between adventures" and "Travel" endeavours.

- **None**: The character won't do any endeavour.

A chat card will appear with the desired endeavour. If chosen a "Between adventures" endeavour from the Core module, it will show a journal link (v10 journal pages). Not available yet for "Travel" or extra endeavours.

![Endeavours Card](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/accd7b21-84ee-416e-9714-2fb2144b2108)

Some endeavours have one or more items appearing in the chat card. The GM or the player can drag it to the character sheet and a roll dialog will show. As the GM, class or other can change the difficulty or modifiers, you can edit this dialog if needed.

An extra message will show in the result card for extra flavor.

### Money to Burn

Select one or more PC tokens (it won't work on NPCs or Creatures), execute the "Money to Burn" macro and that's it, money is gone.

Works with modules that translates money too.

## Extra Endeavours
- Since version 1.1.0 there is a module settings menu for GMs where they can select extra endeavours from **Altdorf: Crown of the Empire** and **Patrons of the Old World I & II**. They all are "Between adventures" endeavours.

GMs can consider this as "unlocking" these endeavours if the PCs are in Altdorf or met these patrons.

- Version 1.2.0 includes endeavours from **Up in Arms**, **Winds of Magic** and **Sea of Claws**. They all are optional "Between adventures" endeavours.

Activating Sea of Claws endeavours will replace the "Between adventures" endeavours with the ones available at sea.

- Version 1.3.0 adds endeavours from **Lustria**.

Activating Lustria endeavours will add "Between Adventures" endeavours and replace the "Travel" ones.

- Version 1.6.2 adds the optional "Between Adventures" endeavour from **Dwarf Player's Guide**.

## Contributions
Only the endeavours from the Core Rulebook, Up in arms, Winds of Magic and Sea of Claws modules have journal links included. If you want to contribute and have Enemy in Shadows, Altdorf: Crown of the Empire and/or Old World Bundle I Foundry modules, you can help me with the rest of the journal links.
